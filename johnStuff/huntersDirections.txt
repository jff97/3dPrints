For primer I use Vallejo but I don't think its think enough to fill with, there is a king of modeling putty 
people use called greenstuff that might work.
I have never needed to sand models before, but I would say a model/hobby knife should be able to handle most 
spurs and then you can smooth it with a really high grit sandpaper.
Endless your model is going to be exposed to the elements you shouldn't need a protective coating.
The layers I do for painting are:
Primer
Base coat
Wash (Darker shade of the base coat or some kind of black that has been water down)
Drybrush (Lighter shade of the base coat or some kind of white that is lightly applied to edges)
